# Generative AI - Applications and Implications
## Professor Jordan Usdan

Although Generative AI holds the promise of being a transformative tool for humanity, its impact on society will be unpredictable. In this course, students will explore AI applications, societal implications, and governance.

## Course Description
We have entered the era of Generative AI, which holds transformational potential akin to the industrial revolution or the advent of the Internet. This technology is now capable of comprehending and generating language, code, images, and videos, performing routine digital tasks, and aiding humans in advancing scientific and creative fields. These intelligent capabilities are powering novel AI user experiences such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Microsoft’s Copilot and other proprietary and open-source offerings. These innovations can boost human productivity and creativity, but their impact on society is unpredictable long-term. By immersing ourselves in the study of Generative AI, we not only equip ourselves for personal growth but also become architects of a future where we can help steer technology to serve humanity’s highest aspirations.

This course explores the broad impacts of generative AI by considering its applications, societal implications, and how organization can govern its usage. We will explore how leveraging AI tools can help us as individuals thrive in our personal and professional lives. We will learn how both governments and private enterprises are seeking to develop beneficial and safe AI aligned with human needs.

This course will provide students with practical exposure to the latest AI technologies. Students will learn the art of prompt engineering, how to use AI as a research, writing and thinking tool, and strategies to avoid common AI failure points.

The first part of the course will cover how generative AI is created and applied, including the potential for it to augment human capabilities in beneficial ways. This includes a host of in-class activities using Microsoft Copilot, ChatGPT and other AI tools. This will include workshops on researching and writing with the help of AI.

The second part of the course will cover societal implications and governance, including public
policy. Issues we will cover include:
● Economic and labor impact: Large generative models can be powerful tools to empower humans but could also automate many tasks that were previously done by humans, potentially leading to job loss and disruption in the job market.
● Information and ecosystem impact: Large generative models can be used to help moderate polarizing conversations, but they can also generate fake information (called hallucinations) and can be used to create deepfakes, poisoning the information commons.
● Data ownership impact: AI relies on training data in the form of text, images, and videos to learn patterns to understand and generate related output. However, open questions remain on how to compensate content owners and reward the creativity of content producers in the age of AI.

Course content will involve hands-on AI activities, including the creation of audio and video “deepfakes” and “red teaming” of models. We will dissect AI public policy debates across the US, EU and international realms. Additionally, we will explore techniques for responsible AI development and release at organizations.

* Note: AI tools such as ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot were used to help generate themes to cover in
this course and to find readings, generate activities to support this curriculum, and help edit this syllabus
for clarity.

## Course Learning Outcomes
The main learning objectives of the course are to:

1. Explore and utilize generative AI tools, learning hands-on ways to integrate them into daily routines through crafting text prompts for diverse tasks. Students will also learn strategies to avoid hallucinations, ensuring the generated outputs are accurate and reliable.
2. Discover the art of co-authoring with AI, understanding the advantages and limitations of language models in writing.
3. Gain a high-level understanding of the science behind generative AI, encompassing how it predicts text sequences and creates images. Students will grasp the fundamentals of AI training, fine-tuning, and inference while staying abreast of current trends in the field.
4. Delve into the societal ramifications of Generative AI through economic, political, ethical, and business perspectives. Engage in discussions to form opinions and debate the potential unforeseen effects of generative AI on society.
5. Devise public policy strategies aimed at alleviating the adverse impacts of this technology on society.
6. Pose insightful questions to experts and critically assess their viewpoints.
7. Learn the principles of responsible AI governance within organizations, including red teaming and responsible release strategies.
8. Articulate well-informed recommendations to decision-makers on complex issues, presenting concise and substantiated arguments.
