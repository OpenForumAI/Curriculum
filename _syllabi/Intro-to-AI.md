# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
## Professor David Steier

The course begins by describing what the latest generation of artificial intelligence techniques can actually do. The course further illustrates both the potential and current limitations of these techniques with examples from a variety of applications. Students will work to understand the strengths and weaknesses of human decision-making and learning, specifically in combination with AI systems. 

## Course Description
Driven by the combination of increased access to data, computational power, and improved sensors and algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are entering the mainstream of technological innovation. These technologies include machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing and the emerging area of generative AI.

After an introduction of some basic AI concepts and techniques, the course illustrates both the potential and current limitations of these techniques with examples from a variety of applications. We spend some time on understanding the strengths and weaknesses of human decision-making and learning, specifically in combination with AI systems and on ethical and policy implications of new AI capabilities. Exercises will include hands-on application of basic AI techniques as well as selection of appropriate technologies for a given problem and anticipation of design implications. In a final project, groups of students will participate in the creation of an AI-based application.

## Course Learning Outcomes
The main learning objectives of the course are to:

1. Identify problems where artificial intelligence techniques are applicable
2. Apply selected basic AI techniques; judge applicability of more advanced techniques.
3. Participate in the design of systems that act intelligently and learn from experience.

## Skills
Technical expertise (machine learning, deep learning, Python programming, computer vision, NLP, LLMs, reinforcement learning, model evaluations, MLOps), AI applications, data analysis, ethical analysis, project management, research, policy analysis, collaboration, analytical reasoning, systems thinking
