# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
## Professor David Steier

The course begins by describing what the latest generation of artificial intelligence techniques can actually do. The course further illustrates both the potential and current limitations of these techniques with examples from a variety of applications. Students will work to understand the strengths and weaknesses of human decision-making and learning, specifically in combination with AI systems. 


## Course Learning Outcomes
The main learning objectives of the course are to:

1. Identify problems where artificial intelligence techniques are applicable
2. Apply selected basic AI techniques; judge applicability of more advanced techniques.
3. Participate in the design of systems that act intelligently and learn from experience.
