## Course Description
As the world rapidly embraces Artificial Intelligence, the potential for both benefit and harm escalates. This course, "Responsible AI: Principles, Policies, and Practices," navigates the complexities of responsible AI use. Our focus is on providing a detailed and practical understanding of the key risks and harms traditional and generative AI can pose, the principles guiding ethical use of AI, and the intricacies of how these harms manifest themselves in the AI lifecycle. This course places a strong emphasis on bias, fairness, transparency, explainability, safety, security, privacy, and accountability, demystifying these foundational concepts and highlighting their relevance in the end-to-end AI life cycle.

Delve into the regulatory landscape of AI as we dissect policymaking worldwide and scrutinize responsible AI frameworks adopted by leading organizations. You'll gain valuable insight into the emerging standards, certifications, and accreditation programs that are guiding the responsible use of AI, Generative AI, and Large Language Models. Building on this knowledge, the course will help you understand the integral role of governance in AI and the pivotal role that various stakeholders play in this landscape. Our unique approach combines theory with practical strategy, enabling you to develop a comprehensive operational plan for implementing responsible AI within an organization. The course culminates with the creation of a strategy and handbook tailored to the needs of an organization. Furthermore, we will equip you with the skills to communicate effectively, making a compelling case for implementing a responsible AI program. Several guest lectures from practitioners and policy makers, coupled with synthetic case scenarios will give you a window into how organizations and policy making bodies are advancing the responsible use of AI.

Whether you're a technology enthusiast or policy student, if you possess a basic understanding of data science and artificial intelligence, this course is a golden opportunity to immerse yourself in the riveting world of responsible AI. Join us as we explore, analyze, and operationalize Responsible AI from a vantage point that fuses ethical considerations with technical prowess.

## Course Learning Outcomes
The main learning objectives of the course are to:

1. Understand and Apply Foundational Principles of Responsible AI: Identify and evaluate key ethical concepts such as bias, fairness, and transparency, and apply global AI regulatory frameworks to industry use cases.
2. Assess Short- and Long-Term AI Risks to Stakeholders: Critically assess the risks and harms AI poses to different stakeholders (individuals, corporations, society), especially in high-impact sectors like healthcare and finance.
3. Apply the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (RMF): Learn to apply the NIST AI RMF to assess risks in AI systems, focusing on security, fairness, transparency, and governance, and develop practical strategies for managing these risks across the AI lifecycle.
4. Measure and Mitigate Bias and Fairness in AI Systems: Apply fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, predictive parity) and evaluate strategies for mitigating bias in AI systems, focusing on real-world applications in healthcare, finance, and criminal justice.
5. Enhance AI Explainability and Transparency: Apply techniques such as LIME and SHAP to improve the explainability of AI models, balancing transparency with accuracy for diverse stakeholders in technical and non-technical roles.
6. Evaluate and Address AI Privacy Risks: Analyze privacy risks in AI systems (e.g., data reconstruction, membership inference), and apply privacy-enhancing technologies (e.g., differential privacy, homomorphic encryption) to mitigate these risks.
7. Ensure AI Safety, Robustness, and Reliability: Measure and manage AI safety risks, including adversarial attacks and model drift, by implementing adversarial training and stress testing, focusing on robustness and resilience across deployment environments.
8. Develop and Apply AI Governance Tools: Apply governance tools, such as AI impact assessments and algorithmic audits, to ensure the ethical deployment of AI, and compare global approaches to AI governance (e.g., U.S., EU, Singapore).
9. Implement Responsible AI Systems in Real-World Contexts: Develop governance frameworks using real-world case studies, integrating fairness, transparency, safety, and privacy practices to responsibly manage AI systems.
