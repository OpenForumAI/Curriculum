# Public Sector AI Curriculum
In order to prepare professionals to work with open-source AI in the public sector, Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy has released an open-source curriculum of four courses: Introduction to AI; Fundamentals of Operationalizing AI; Responsible AI: Principles, Policies, and Practices; and Generative AI: Applications, Implications, and Governance. Collectively, these courses introduce students to the knowledge and skills requisite to understand the foundations of AI design and implementation, including opportunities, risks, limitations, and frontier developments.
In order to prepare professionals to work with open-source AI... including opportunities, risks, limitations, and frontier developments. <br><br>

 The above syllabi outline content and readings relevant to the learning objectives covered by each course. In order to build upon the syllabi and develop courses relevant to your specific student population, LLM prompts can be useful for developing activities and detailed course content.
 <br>
 
**For example, these prompts can help you develop activities related to specific content:**
  <ul style="margin-top: 0.5em;">
    <li>Using this syllabus, create an interactive activity that focuses on AI interpretability methods for a class of 20 graduate students. It should be done in small groups and take approximately 20-30 minutes.</li> <br>
   
**These prompts can help you develop content related to specific skills:**
    <li>Using this syllabus, create an interactive activity that focuses on AI-related policy writing for a class of 20 graduate students. It should be done in pairs and take approximately 15 minutes.</li> <br>
  </ul>
